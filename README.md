# Best Sellers Shopify

- I didn't separated concerns (JS, CSS) just to make it easier to analyze while opening. And I could have used some scroll library such as Slick Slider but the test was asking to only use Vanilla JS
- If you need any changes or any new feature(s), please let me know that I'll do it immediately!

PS: I couldn't deploy to a new Shopify store because I don't have the account anymore, although I can deploy to a free account if you want (which is available for a limited time - I think 3 days)
