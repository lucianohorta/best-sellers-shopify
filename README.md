# Best Sellers Shopify

- I couldn't deploy to a new Shopify store because I don't have the account anymore, although I can deploy to a free account if you want (which is available for a limited time - I think 3 days)
- I didn't separated concerns (js, css) just to make it easier to analyze while opening. Also I could use some scroll library such as Slick Slider but the test was implicit to only use JS
- If you need any changes or any new feature(s), please let me know that I'll do it immediately!
